  # Frequently asked questions.
  faq:
    - question: "What is a hackathon?"
      answer: >
        A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
        software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's [very beginner friendly](https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl).
    - question: "What can I create?"
      answer: >
        There will be four different categories: Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, FinTech, and Creative.
        You can build anything that falls under the first three categories. Anything else will be considered under the Creative category. There are no limits to your creativity!
    - question: "How much does it cost?"
      answer: >
        Nothing. Attending a hackathon is free.

        The event is being hosted at Wealthsimple in the city of Toronto, Ontario.
    - question: "What if I don't know how to code?"

        That's completely fine! A hackathon is a great place to gain some experience. We will have workshops, tutorials, and mentors to guide you through your project.
